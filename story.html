              MHKlara is a dream by four Engineering Students earlier in 2014.
              "The true art of storytelling involves writing active characters
              who engage the audience" this was the inspiration to continue our
              work on the story by then. The name 'MHKlara' was an accident to
              us, we never came up with a better name than this.

              "Each success has some failure along the way", we believed in
              this. At first when we planned to shoot some of the videos we
              never able to execute the plan. This picture was in the year 2014
              where we have the shooting for the first time and this was our
              poster.

              Later, after three years in 2017 again we are back with ideas and
              started to shoot. We completed the shoot, but again we failed
              could not publish online. These failures taught us some many
              things and we fixed our mindset until we come up with the complete
              plan we will never shoot again.
